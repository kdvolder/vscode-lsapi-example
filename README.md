# VS Code Language Server Example in Java

The repo contains work in progress. It is an 'exercise' to implement
a simple VS Code Language Server in Java. 

The starting point is a clone of this repo:

https://github.com/georgewfraser/vscode-javac

It provides Java support using the javac API.

As such that repo contains all the pieces necessary
to create a working Language Server. In this
exercise we strip it down to the bare minimum
to make a very basic language server similar to
the one built in the 
[VScode tutorial on building a language server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-language-server). 

# Oringal README

The contents of the original readme of the cloned repo is below. 
Should probably be edited / removed. Keeping it for now in case
there's something useful in there we might still need.

## Usage

The presence of a `javaconfig.json` file indicates that 
its parent directory is the root of a Java module.
`javaconfig.json` looks like:

    {
        "sourcePath": ["relative/path/to/source/root", ...],
        "classPathFile": "file-with-classpath-as-contents.txt",
        "outputDirectory": "relative/path/to/output/root"
    }
    
The classpath is contained in a separate file, 
in the format `entry.jar:another-entry.jar`.
This file is usually generated by a build tool like maven.

### Examples

### Maven

You can configure maven to output the current classpath to a file, 
classpath.txt, where Visual Studio Code will find it.

#### javaconfig.json

Set the source path, and get the class path from a file:

    {
        "sourcePath": ["src/main/java"],
        "classPathFile": "classpath.txt",
        "outputDirectory": "target"
    }

#### pom.xml

Configure maven to output `classpath.txt`

    <project ...>
        ...
        <build>
            ...
            <plugins>
                ...
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.9</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <id>build-classpath</id>
                            <phase>generate-sources</phase>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>build-classpath</goal>
                            </goals>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                    <configuration>
                        <outputFile>classpath.txt</outputFile>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </project>

#### .gitignore

Ignore `classpath.txt`, since it will be different on every host

    classpath.txt
    ...
    
## Directory structure

### Java service process

A java process that does the hard work of parsing and analyzing .java source files.

    pom.xml (maven project file)
    src/ (java sources)
    repo/ (tools.jar packaged in a local maven repo)
    target/ (compiled java .class files, .jar archives)
    target/fat-jar.jar (single jar that needs to be distributed with extension)

### Typescript Visual Studio Code extension

"Glue code" that launches the external java process
and connects to it using [vscode-languageclient](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient).

    package.json (node package file)
    tsconfig.json (typescript compilation configuration file)
    tsd.json (project file for tsd, a type definitions manager)
    lib/ (typescript sources)
    out/ (compiled javascript)

## Design

This extension consists of an external java process, 
which communicates with vscode using the [language server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-protocol). 

### Java service process

The java service process uses the implementation of the Java compiler in tools.jar, 
which is a part of the JDK.
When VS Code needs to lint a file, perform autocomplete, 
or some other task that requires Java code insight,
the java service process invokes the Java compiler programatically,
then intercepts the data structures the Java compiler uses to represent source trees and types.

### Incremental updates

The Java compiler isn't designed for incremental parsing and analysis.
However, it is *extremely* fast, so recompiling a single file gives good performance,
as long as we don't also recompile all of its dependencies.
We accomplish this by maintaining a single copy of the Java compiler in memory at all times.
When we want to recompile a file, 
we clear that *one* file from the internal caches of the Java compiler,
and then rerun the compiler.

### Multiple javaconfig.json

If you have multiple javaconfig.json files in different subdirectories of your project,
the parent directory of each javaconfig.json will be treated as a separate java root.

## Logs

The java service process will output a log file with a name like 'javac-services.0.log'
in your project directory.
